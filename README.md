# Dataset Summary
This project uses the Amazon Sales Dataset . The dataset contains sales information such as product category, price, discount percentage, quantity sold, customer region, and payment method.
# Part 2: Defining the Machine Learning Problem
1. Is this a regression, classification, or clustering problem? it is regression.
2. Is there a target variable? Total Revenue.
3. What is the model expected to learn or predict? The model is expected to learn pattrens from sales data and predict total revennue .

   product categroy, price discount precentage , quantity sold ,customer regionand
   revenue. This is regression problem because the output is a continuous numeric value.
