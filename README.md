# Lab2 : Amazon sales Dataset
# Dataset Summary
This project uses the Amazon Sales Dataset . The dataset contains sales information such as product category, price, discount percentage, quantity sold, customer region, and payment method.
# Part 2: Defining the Machine Learning Problem
1. Is this a regression, classification, or clustering problem? it is regression.
2. Is there a target variable? Total Revenue.
3. What is the model expected to learn or predict? The model is expected to learn pattrens from sales data and predict total revennue .

   Proplem Explaination : The goal of this project is to to predict total revenue based on
   product categroy, price discount precentage , quantity sold ,customer regionand
   revenue. This is regression problem because the output is a continuous numeric value.
# Part 3: Loading and Inspecting the Dataset in Python
There is uploaded Jupyter Notebook 
# Part 4: Designing the Methodology Diagram
The methodology diagram shows the machine learning workflow used in this project.
It starts with selecting the Amazon Sales dataset, loading the data using Python and Pandas,
and preprocessing the dataset.
Next, the data is split into training and testing sets. A regression model is trained,
evaluated using the test data, and the results are analyzed.
